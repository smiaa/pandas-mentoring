These are some of the things I have learnt while creating pull requests:

Merge conflicts isn't as difficult as it sounds, conflict markers and diff are your friends to help recognize where
the conflict(s) is/are and fix them.

Keep asking questions,reading others' feedbacks till you figure out what to do.

When sending a Pull Request(PR), always send from a new branch and not the master.This ensures that your master branch
stays original and keeps your PR tidy. When I sent a PR from my master branch(the original branch where the repo was forked),the new PR included a previous PR and that's not
what I wanted. So for every new PR, a new branch.

If a PR has been merged, treat an edit to its files as a new PR.

Please add what you have learnt above this line with a blank line between each point. Thank you
