# Pandas-Contributors-2019 Survey

 Hello folks ,

Happy to be one of the energetic fellow among you all. We are a sufficient pack of people who really want to make their mark. And this is our opportunity for the same. Regardless of where we are now and what we know, we are all in the same mission and we will be there to support each other ***sharing is always caring :)***.
As I mentioned earlier we are a diverse group and that is what the pandas contributors were lacking of . And here we are .There are many constrains for each of us to participate in the program fully. It would be great if we have a scholarship which will support us to be a full time pandas contributor (in my opinion, if you have anything different in mind please share :))
So lets participate in a survey which will help understand us better. The main aim of the survey is to get a better understanding of ourselves like who we are, where are we from, what  we are doing , do we need a scholarship  ,if yes, why etc 


Please add the questions that you feel can be included in the survey. 
(feel free to edit the content given below :)  )
